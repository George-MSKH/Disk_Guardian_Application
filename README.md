System Resource Monitor

System Resource Monitor is a Python-based tool that tracks disk, CPU, and memory usage, logs usage over time, and sends alerts to Slack when thresholds are exceeded or recovered.

This project runs in Docker for easy deployment.

Features

Monitors disk, CPU, and memory usage.

Configurable thresholds via environment variables.

Real-time alerts via Slack webhook.

Logs usage and alerts in JSON for programmatic use.

Optional human-readable log for easy debugging.

Supports Docker for isolated and consistent environment.

Folder Structure

│  └─ logs/            # Logs generated by the script

Environment Variables

Set these in a .env file or your shell:

SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXX/YYYY/ZZZZ
DISK_THRESHOLD=80.0
CPU_THRESHOLD=75.0
MEM_THRESHOLD=80.0


SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL – Slack webhook URL for alerts

DISK_THRESHOLD – Disk usage percentage to trigger alerts

CPU_THRESHOLD – CPU usage percentage to trigger alerts

MEM_THRESHOLD – Memory usage percentage to trigger alerts

Running with Docker

Build the Docker image:

docker compose build


Run the container:

docker compose up


Logs will appear in the terminal.

JSON heartbeat logs: app/logs/heartbeat_log_*.json

JSON alert logs: app/logs/alert_log_*.json

Human-readable logs: app/logs/log.txt (if enabled)

Log Files

Heartbeat logs (heartbeat_log_*.json) – continuous snapshots of disk, CPU, and memory usage

Alert logs (alert_log_*.json) – only created when thresholds are exceeded or usage recovers

Human-readable log (log.txt) – optional, for easier reading while monitoring

Example log.txt entry:

2026-02-20 12:00:56 | CPU | 82.4%
2026-02-20 12:01:06 | Memory | 81.0% | 1.2GB free
2026-02-20 12:01:16 | Disk | 81.5% | 5GB free

How It Works

Script checks disk, CPU, memory every CHECK_INTERVAL seconds.

Each usage snapshot is logged to heartbeat JSON and optionally human-readable logs.

If a threshold is exceeded:

Alert is printed in terminal (!!! Disk usage HIGH: 82%)

Alert is sent to Slack (if configured)

Entry is added to alert_log_*.json and human-readable logs.

When usage drops below threshold:

Recovery message printed (*** Disk usage RECOVERED: 78%)

Alert logged as RECOVERED.

Notes

Default thresholds: Disk 80%, CPU 75%, Memory 80%

Can run on Mac or Linux, but some stress-testing may require EC2 or Linux VM.

JSON logs are for programmatic processing; human-readable logs are for quick inspection.

If you want, I can also add a section for testing alerts quickly, so you can see the alert logs without having to actually hit 80% CPU or disk usage.

Do you want me to add that?
